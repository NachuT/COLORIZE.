**Colorize**
The most **advanced** color correction platform for the visually impaired on the Internet. Colorize enters the market of apps meant to help people who have **any** Colorblind deficiency tell the difference between colors. Our platform uses complex mathematical equations such as gradient partial differentiation, gamma correction and Fourier Transforms iin order to make the most accurate color correction platform possible. Lastly our platform aims to have a working frontend in the future hopefully with a bigger cpu in order to run the partial differention equations.
